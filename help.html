    <h2>ESP File Manager for NodeMCU</h2>
    <p>(Developed using NodeMCU 3.0-master, complete build details below)</p>
    <p>
        This app allows files of any size or type to be uploaded to and downloaded from an ESP8266 or ESP32,
        using any browser [within reason.].
    </p>

    <p>
        When uploading a file, if a file of that name already exists, behavior is dictated by the "if file exists..."
        pulldown:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Backup:</b> Renames the existing file to filename(1).ext.  If that file exists it is deleted (only one backup copy is kept.)</li>
        <li><b>Overwrite:</b>  The original file is overwritten when the upload completes.</li>
        <li><b>Abort:</b> If the file exists the ESP server returns status 403 and the upload is aborted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Capabilities:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No file size limit (up to the capacity of the ESP.)</li>
        <li>All file types are supported, text or binary.</li>
        <li>HTML files and images are rendered in a new browser tab.</li>
        <li>Multiple files can be selected for upload.</li>
        <li>Long file names are supported.</li>
        <li>Up to 5 silmultaneous file downloads (from ESP) are supported. (The sixth exceeds memory capacity.)</li>
        <li>Up to 2 silmultaneous file uploads (to ESP) are supported. (Depending on other activity, anything more than one concurrent upload risks exceeding memory capacity.)</li>
        <li>Provides a directory listing, with a download link for each file.</li>
        <li>Allows files to be deleted and renamed.</li>
        <li>Operates as either a stand-alone AP or as a station connected to your AP.</li>
        <li>The current ESP free heap size is sent as a header with most responses, and can be explicitly requested as well.</li>
        <li>The web page provides a way to edit the app's configuration file and update it on the ESP.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Limitations:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple silmultaneous uploads to the same file name from any hosts, is unsupported.</li>
        <li>File corruption will be the consequence if the condition above occurs.</li>
        <li>Error checking capabilities are extremely limited.</li>
        <li>The upload user interface is the standard input type=file element, however, the upload protocol is not standard, the script code in files.js must be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Setup:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Edit the file cfg.lua to configure this app for your environment.  (See details below.)
        <li>Copy all files in this folder to the ESP file system, using ESplorer or similar.
        <li>Reset the ESP.
    </ul>

    <p><b>Configuration:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ESP can operate in either station or AP mode.</li>
        <li>
            <b>To configure, edit cfg.lua</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AP Mode:
                    <ul>
                        <li>cfg.Mode:  set the value to "AP".  Only the values that start with "AP" apply to this mode.</li>
                        <li>The default values create an open AP using channel 6 with SSID "espfilemgr" using IP address 192.168.4.1</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Station Mode:
                    <ul>
                        <li>cfg.Mode: set the value "Station".  Only the values that start with "Station" apply to this mode.</li>
                        <li>cfg.StationWiFiSSID: Identifies the AP the ESP will connect to.</li>
                        <li>cfg.StationWiFiPwd: The password for the AP that the ESP will connect to.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>Usage:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ESP can operate in either station or AP mode.</li>
        <li>
            Connect to the ESP via network
            <ul>
                <li>If in AP mode you must connect to the ESP as a client using another WiFi device.</li>
                <li>If in station mode, the ESP connects to your WiFi AP and it can be accessed by any other device on the network.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the IP address of the ESP to browse to it using your web browser.  Examples:
            <ul>
                <li>http://192.168.4.1/files.html  (Default address in AP mode.)</li>
                <li>http://192.168.x.x/files.html  (In station mode you must determine the IP address that was assigned, details below.)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>To determine which IP was assigned to the ESP by your network:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In station mode there are a few ways to determine the IP:
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor the ESP's UART output while it is booting, it will dump its assigned IP after connecting.</li>
                <li>Find it in your WiFi AP configuration's list of connected devices (or DHCP clients.)</li>
                <li>
                    Probe the network for it using a PC:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Before powering on the ESP open a console window and execute the command: PING 192.168.255.255&lt;enter&gt; then
                            execute ARP -A&lt;enter&gt; Note the IP addresses listed in the output.
                        </li>
                        <li>Power up the ESP and give it a minute or two to connect.</li>
                        <li>
                            Re-execute the same console commands, look for a new address in the output, use that address to browse to it.  e.g.,
                            if the new address in the list is 192.168.0.6, browse to http://192.168.0.6/files.html or
                            http://192.168.0.6/ (the default file is index.html, which contains a client-side
                            redirect to files.html)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In AP mode the IP of the ESP is set in the configuration file cfg.lua, default is 192.168.4.1
        <li>
            Note that because it uses STATIONAP mode, it effectively works as both when in station mode, but the
            AP has the default configuration, to customize the confifuration it must use AP mode.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        If you want to incorporate this functionality in another app, and you have already configured/connected to a network,
        copy all of the code from init.lua except for the last two lines, to your init file.  You will need to assign either the variable ip or serverip,
        depending on mode.   Then when you want this functionality to be available execute server.lua, e.g., dofile("server.lua")  To disable the
        functionality and recover the memory used by server.lua, reset the ESP.
    </p>

    <p>LFS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can get an extra 10K or so of memory or your ESP by using LFS (a thorough discussion of which can be found
            <a href="https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/dev/lfs/">here</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
            To enable LFS:
            <ul>
                <li>Upload lfs.img to the ESP</li>
                <li>Execute the command node.flashreload("lfs.img") on the ESP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you make any changes to the 3 files that are included in the LFS image, you must recompile them and update the ESP:
            <ul>
                <li>Add the files server.lua, wificfgsvr.lua and fileupload.lua to a zip file, name it lfs.zip.</li>
                <li>Upload the lfs.zip file to <a href="https://blog.ellisons.org.uk/article/nodemcu/a-lua-cross-compile-web-service/">this site</a> to compile it into an LFS image.</li>
                <li>The site will send lfs.img as a download.</li>
                <li>Upload lfs.img to the ESP</li>
                <li>Execute the command node.flashreload("lfs.img") on the ESP</li>
                <li>Delete server.lua, wificfgsvr.lua and fileupload.lua from the ESP</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
